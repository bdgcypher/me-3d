# me-3d

Welcome to **me-3d**, an interactive 3D shape playground built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and React Three Fiber.

## Description

- This project is a simple scene with a light and a shape on a flat surface. The shape can be clicked and dragged around the scene.
- Sparked by an interest in adding some 3D touches to future projects, I created the repo to practice working with R3F and Three.js.

## Features

- Create and manipulate 3D shapes.
- Add textures, materials, and lighting.
- Explore different camera angles and perspectives.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React Three Fiber
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
